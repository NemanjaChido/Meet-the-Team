### What I learned
Working on this project impacted on my knowledge of css grid property greatly.The use of grid-span and grid-start made positioning the contents a lot easier, efficient and maintainable across different screen szies!!!
Then again, i found the use of clamp() function to define text sizes across different screens, a lot more efficient to say the least. Therefore, i'll definately stick to it from here on! 

### Useful resources

### Built with
